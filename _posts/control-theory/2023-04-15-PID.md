## Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) Controller

A PID controller is a control loop mechanism employing feedback. It continuously calculates an error value e ( t ) e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms.[^1]

$$u(t)=K_pe(t)+K_i\int_0^t e(\tau)d\tau + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}$$


### PID tuning methods[^3]
* **Heuristic Tuning**

* **Rule-based Tuning**
  * assume a certain process response to obtain easy mathematical formulas that enable the tuning of a PID controller
  * The process characteristics can be derived from simple experiments and are used to calculate the PID parameters.
  * sensitive to discrepancies with respect to the assumed process response
  * examples:
    * Ziegler-Nichols tuning method
    * Cohen-Coon tuning method
    * Kappa-tau tuning method
    * Lambda tuning method
* **Model-based Tuning**
  * The control objectives together with a model of your system and the engineering specifications of the closed loop behavior determine the final set of tuning parameters.
