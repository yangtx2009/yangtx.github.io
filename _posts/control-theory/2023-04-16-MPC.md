## Model Prediction Controller (MPC)

Model predictive control (MPC) is a control scheme where a model is used for predicting the future behavior of the system over finite time window, the horizon.[^1]

Advantages in comparison to PID etc.
* Proactive control action
* Non-linear control
* Arbitrary control objective
* Constrained formulation

### Algorithms

#### Timed Elastic Bands (TEB)[^2]

#### Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) Controller[^3]
Here is the tutorial video.[^4]
General plant system model:
$$dx=(f(x_t,t)+G(x_t,t)u(x_t,t))dt+B(x_t,t)dw$$


* Simulate into the future: run thousands of "rollouts"
* Each rollout has randomly different inputs. (randomly sample in the map)
$$u+\delta u_k \in \mathcal{R}^4$$
* "Best" input = potential weighted sum of inputs. Rollout has low cost => Inputs get large weight
$$\begin{split}
u=u+\frac{\sum_k w_k\delta u_k}{\sum_k w_k}\\
w_k=e^{-\frac{1}{\lambda} S_k}
\end{split}$$
