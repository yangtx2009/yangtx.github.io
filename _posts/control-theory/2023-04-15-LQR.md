## Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)

### Background

A dynamic system can be described by a set of diferential equations, e.g.:
$$\dot{x} = f(x)$$

A state-space equation is a mathematical model of a physical system specified as a set of input, output and variables related by first-order (not involving second derivatives) differential equations or difference equations. We can define it in a general way:

$$\begin{split}\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)+Bu(t)\\ y(t) = Cx(t)+Du(t)\end{split}$$

* $x(t)$: state vector. represents the state of the system (or system energy)
* $A$: represents the relationship between the linear combination of the state and its derivate inside of the system.
* $u(t)$: input/control vector, which represents the outside factor (pedal, brake, steering, ...).
* $B$: linear combination of inputs.
* $y(t)$: output vector. 
* $C$: if the output (measurement) is state ifself, then $C$ is a unit matrix.
* $D$: bypass of input to the output. usually it is zero matrix.

### Approach

Linear quadratic regulator (LQR or 线性二次型调节器) is a simplified solution to dynamic programning problem in controlling. Its target is to **find an optimal control sequence ${u_0,u_1,...}$** (acceleration, steering angle, ...)**, which enables the vehicle tracking a planned trajectory with the lowest effort.**

The cost-to-go function is defined as
$$J = \sum_0^{t_f}(x_k^T Q x_k+u_k^T R u_k+2x_k^TNu_k)$$

* Q: performance penalty to the cost
* R: effort penalty to the cost

### Implementations

Assumed that a system state vector $\mathbf{x}_{t}$ which describe the error state (误差状态) of the vehicle at timestamp $t$, e.g.:
$$\mathbf{x}_{t} = \begin{bmatrix}e_t \\ (e_t-e_{t-1})/dt \\ \theta_t \\ (\theta_t-\theta_{t-1})/dt \end{bmatrix}$$

* $e_t$: the distance error between target and actual position of the vehicle at timestamp t.
* $(e_t-pe_t)/dt$: the derivate of the distance errors between t and t-1. $pe$=previous error.
* $\theta_t$: the error between target and actual heading angle.
* $d\theta_t/dt$: the derivate of the angle errors between t and t-1.

In the ideal case, we want no difference between target and actual states, or $\mathbf{x}_{t} = \mathbf{0}$. Meanwhile, keep the lowest control cost $\mathbf{u}_{t} = \mathbf{0}$.
