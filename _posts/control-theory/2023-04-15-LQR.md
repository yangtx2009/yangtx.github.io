## Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)

### Background

A dynamic system can be described by a set of diferential equations, e.g.:
$$\dot{x} = f(x)$$

A state-space equation is a mathematical model of a physical system specified as a set of input, output and variables related by first-order (not involving second derivatives) differential equations or difference equations. We can define it in continuous-time:

$$\begin{split}\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)+Bu(t)\\ y(t) = Cx(t)+Du(t)\end{split}$$

* $x(t)$: state vector. represents the state of the system (or system energy)
* $A$: represents the relationship between the linear combination of the state and its derivate inside of the system.
* $u(t)$: input/control vector, which represents the outside factor (pedal, brake, steering, ...).
* $B$: linear combination of inputs.
* $y(t)$: output vector. 
* $C$: if the output (measurement) is state ifself, then $C$ is a unit matrix.
* $D$: bypass of input to the output. usually it is zero matrix.

In case of **discrete-time**,
$$x(t+1) = Ax(t)+Bu(t)$$

### Approach

Linear quadratic regulator (LQR or 线性二次型调节器) is a simplified solution to dynamic programning problem in controlling. Its target is to **find an optimal control sequence ${u_0,u_1,...}$** (acceleration, steering angle, ...)**, which enables the vehicle tracking a planned trajectory with the lowest energy cost.**

For an infinite-horizon, which means there is no final state, the system energy (or cost function) is

 $$J = \int_0^{\infty}(x_k^T Q x_k+u_k^T R u_k+ \bcancel{2x_k^TNu_k})$$

 * Q: performance penalty to the cost.
* R: control effort penalty to the cost
* N: since, in most cases, resulting energy can be seperated into internal (represented by $x$ only) and external (introduced by $u$ only), $N$ is zero matrix.

We are only interested in the possible minimal energy of states and inputs.
Thus, we need to calculate the quadratic of $x$ and $u$. 
Since the terms represent energy, Q, R, N must be positive-definite matrix, which means the three terms must be all positive.

If every component of $x$ (the same as $u$) is independent of each other, for example the kinestic energy only depends on the speed, then Q (or R) will be a diagonal matrix.


Its **discrete-time**, **finite-horizon** version is

$$J= x_{t_f}^T Q x_{t_f} + \sum_{k=0}^{t_f-1}(x_k^T Q x_k+u_k^T R u_k)$$

At the final timestamp, we do not give any input. Thus, we have only state energy but no input energy.

#### LQR Controller

Assumed that all states are measurable, then we can design a full state feedback controller. The control signal $u$ is a linear combination of observed state vector. Our goal is to regulate the plant system so that the state $x$ becomes $0$ through finding an optimal $K$ which minimizes the cost function of the plant system.

If we replace $u$ by the gain function in $J$, and assume that matrix $P$ exists, then we get
$$J= \int_{0}^{\infty}x^T (Q+K^TRK) x dt = -x^TPx$$

$x(t\rightarrow\infty)\rightarrow 0$.

After we conduct the derivate of $J$, we can get a converged value of $P$ through calculating the algebraic Riccati differential equation iteratively. (The inference process can be found in [link](https://blog.csdn.net/ChenGuiGan/article/details/116483597)).
$$A^TP+PA-(PB)R^{-1}(B^TP)+Q=0$$

Finally, we can get the control gain matrix $K=R^{-1}B^TP$ and get control vector $u = -Kx$.

### Implementations

#### Lateral Control Only
Assumed that a system state vector $\mathbf{x}_{t}$ which describe the error state (误差状态) of the vehicle at timestamp $t$, e.g.:
$$\mathbf{x}_{t} = \begin{bmatrix}e_t \\ (e_t-e_{t-1})/dt \\ \theta_t \\ (\theta_t-\theta_{t-1})/dt \end{bmatrix}$$

* $e_t$: the lateral distance error (横向距离误差) between target and actual position of the vehicle at timestamp t.
* $(e_t-e_{t-1})/dt$: the derivate of the distance errors between t and t-1. $pe$=previous error.
* $\theta_t$: the angular error (方向误差) between target and actual heading.
* $(\theta_t-\theta_{t-1})/dt$: the derivate of the angle errors between t and t-1.

In the ideal case, we want no difference between target and actual states, or $\mathbf{x}_{t} = \mathbf{0}$. Meanwhile, keep the lowest control cost $\mathbf{u}_{t} = \mathbf{0}$.

Since we only control the lateral movement with LQR, the input (or control) is the steering angle of the front wheel. We can then define the state-space equation as:

$$x(t+1) = 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    1.0 & dt & 0 & 0 \\ 
    0 & 0 & v & 0 \\ 
    0 & 0 & 1.0 & dt \\ 
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}}_{A}
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
    e_t \\ (e_{t+1}-e_{t})/dt \\ 
    \theta_t \\ 
    (\theta_{t+1}-\theta_{t})/dt 
\end{bmatrix}}_{x(t)}+ 
\underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ v/L
\end{bmatrix}}_{B}\underbrace{\omega}_{u(t)}$$

$v$ is the longitudinal speed of the vehicle, which is provided by the longitudinal movement controller (e.g. PID). The initial matrix $Q$ and $R$ can be unit matrix at the beginning. With the help of discrete LQR, we can finally get $K$ and the steering angle.
